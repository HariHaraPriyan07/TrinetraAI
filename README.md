Trinetra is a Generative‑AI powered assistant that helps users verify information and learn how to spot misleading content. It goes beyond simple fact‑checking by explaining why something looks suspicious, highlighting manipulation patterns, and pointing to credible sources.

✨ Why Trinetra

Misinformation is a public risk: It fuels social unrest, health scares, and scams.

Verification is hard: Most people lack quick, accessible tools to assess credibility.

Education is key: Sustainable impact comes from teaching users how to think, not just giving a verdict.
